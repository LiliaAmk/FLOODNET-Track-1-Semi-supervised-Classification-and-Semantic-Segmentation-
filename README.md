# FLOODNET-Track-1-Semi-supervised-Classification-and-Semantic-Segmentation-

This repository contains a complete pipeline for **semi-supervised image classification** on the FloodNet dataset, developed for Track 1 of the FloodNet Challenge. The main goal is to classify images into **flooded** and **non-flooded** categories using both **labeled** and **unlabeled** data. The project leverages **ResNet50**, data augmentation, and class rebalancing to enhance model performance.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Steps

### 1.  Data Exploration

- Display and visualize flooded and non-flooded images along with their masks.
- Visualize unlabeled images for general inspection.

### 2.  Preprocessing

- **Resizing** all images to 224x224 pixels.
- **Normalization** of pixel values (0 to 1 range).
- **Data Augmentation** to improve model generalization.
- **Splitting** the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

### 3.  Model Selection & Training

- Used **ResNet50** (pre-trained on ImageNet) as the backbone.
- Fine-tuned with a custom classifier (GAP â†’ Dense â†’ Dropout â†’ Dense).
- **Data generators** were created for both labeled and unlabeled datasets.
- Implemented two training settings:
  - **Basic Semi-supervised Learning**
  - **Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning** with:
    - Data augmentation
    - Class weighting to handle imbalance

### 4.  Inference on Unlabeled Data

- Predicted labels for 3,312 unlabeled images.
- Classified them into:
  - Flooded: 500 images
  - Non-Flooded: 2,812 images
- Saved the classified images into separate folders.

| IoU (placeholder)       | 0.25           | 0.25                              |
| Flooded Predicted       | 0              | 500                               |
| Non-Flooded Predicted   | 3,312          | 2,812                             |
